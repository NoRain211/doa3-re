# DOA3 D3D8 3925 draw bindings

Address/offset map for the draw, render-state, texture, vertex-shader and tile
adapters. The 4928 column identifies the copied DOAXBV layout, not DOA3
facts. Evidence addresses name DOA3 disassembly. Unverified fields are not
used by the DOA3 draw path. No instruction bytes are recorded here.

Only the first 18 APIs are newly manual. Draw calls replace their library
bodies wholesale. DrawVertices and DrawVerticesUP share the indexed presenter
path using sequential host indices. The DOA3 path supports fixed-function
single-stream layouts and the verified programmable water layout described
below. Other declarations and advanced materials remain unverified.
SetTransform, SetPalette, resource creation/destruction and unused state
setters remain generated. The resource-destruction seam is also marked
beside its dispatch in `d3d_texture_adapter.c`.

| Format descriptor table | `0x001F16B8` | `0x001BEF20` | `0x001B11EA`, `0x001BA0BF` |

The surface decoder's field positions match 3925. `0x001B9F40` verifies the
width/height fields and linear pitch; `0x001B11B0` verifies pitch and format
lookup; `0x001BA090` verifies render-target/depth descriptor flags. Surface
objects occupy `0x18` bytes. Texture unbind does not overwrite the format cache
in 3925. Tile descriptors occupy six words; words at `+0x10` and `+0x14` are
cleared for ordinary, non-depth-compressed tiles (`0x001B1F54`-`0x001B1F62`).

The FVF builder at `0x001B3BB0` clears `0x16C` bytes. Declaration flags remain
at `+4`; position/weights/normal/diffuse/specular offset-and-format pairs move
from `+0x18/+0x1C` with stride `0x10` to `+0x2C/+0x30`. Texture pairs move
from `+0xA8/+0xAC` to `+0x12C/+0x130`; coordinate sizes are separate words at
`+0x18 + 4*stage`, and count is at `+0xC`. This differs from 4928's packed
coordinate sizes at `+0x10`. The adapter translates the existing FVF model
into this layout; it does not reinterpret 4928 declaration memory as 3925.

## Additional copied draw reads

The DOA3 programmable draw path uses the verified viewport and program
fields below. Copied DOAXBV effects and game-owned diagnostics remain
inactive for DOA3.

Fixed-function lighting has its own DOA3 path, `attach_doa3_lighting`. A
census of paced fights found lighting on about 95% of fixed-function draws
with normals: always textured, never with vertex color, two to four point and
directional lights, specular on about 77% of them (material power 30-40), no
spot lights, no two-sided lighting and no local viewer. The host evaluates
D3D lighting per vertex in world space: scene ambient plus emissive, per-light
ambient and diffuse with point-light range and attenuation, and specular with
a non-local viewer. Stage 0 combines texture and lit diffuse with
SELECTARG1, SELECTARG2 or MODULATE, and specular is added after it. Spot
lights, two-sided lighting, vertex color sources and an enabled stage 1 keep
the unlit path. Every lit draw also enables linear table fog, which the host
does not model yet.

## Upstream execution dependency

| Entry / field | DOA3 address / offset | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Main frame loop | `0x000A06D0` | Generated |
| Game fiber scheduler | `0x0009E67B` | Generated |
| Scheduler switch call | `0x0009E751` | Calls `0x00164FEF` |
| XAPI SwitchToFiber | `0x00164FEF` | Unbound; generated C returns to its caller after guest stack replacement |
| XAPI CreateFiber / DeleteFiber / ConvertThreadToFiber | `0x00164F50`, `0x00164FDC`, `0x0016502E` | Unbound; outside DRAW ownership |
| Fiber saved stack | `+0x0C` | `0x00165014`, `0x00165017` |
| TLS index | `0x00B228C8` | `0x00164FEF`, `0x0016502E` |

The scheduler's library context switch requires an API replacement. Generated
C's ordinary return cannot resume another fiber's native call stack. This is a
dependency of reaching the game's draw callers, not a reason to force game state.

| Callback recovery | DOA3 address | Lifter status |
|---|---|---|
| Initial game task | `0x00084340` | Address passed at `0x000A06BE`; closed loop without a return |
| Task loop back edge | `0x0008456E` to `0x00084430` | Lifter `d2792f3` recovers bounded, closed callback CFGs, including indexed table arms |
| Callback tail-call dependency | `0x00176DC0` to `0x00176D60` | Lifter `e0df408` scans newly recovered callback bodies for referenced gap entries |
| Second game task / tail exit | `0x00080200` / `0x0008080E` to `0x0009E525` | Lifter `5eed0de` checks conditional edges and permits an unconditional exit to a known function |
| Callback following inline switch data | `0x00050D30` | Lifter `1077fe3` recovers it after proving the preceding `0x00050A10` control flow and tables end before the callback |

The adapter check uses synthetic geometry and an in-memory presenter. Whole-game
rendering also depends on the separate XAPI fiber bindings above. No input/XAPI
implementation is changed by the DRAW commit.

## Sofdec movie frames

Game `0x0009DDB0` creates two 720x480 linear BGRA textures (format `0x12`).
`0x0009E1F0` obtains a decoded frame through `0x00177810`, then
`0x0009DE90` locks the alternate texture through `0x001B4B30` and calls
CRI `0x001762B0`. That wrapper reaches color conversion `0x001779D0` through
`0x00175C90`. Its cdecl arguments are planar Y/U/V pointers and strides,
a four-word destination (pixels, width, height, pitch), and three 256-entry
BGRA word tables. The native adapter reuses `movie_color_model.c`; decoding,
frame readiness, consumption and playback state remain generated.

The game binds that texture with SetTexture `0x001B1CC0` and draws four
XYZRHW/TEX1 vertices (FVF `0x104`, stride 24) as a triangle strip with
DrawVerticesUP `0x001B3760`. UVs are in texels. The existing D3D11 presenter
uploads the mutable linear texture and normalizes those coordinates. This
path does not use a video overlay.

The observed stage state is RGB MODULATE(texture, diffuse), alpha
SELECTARG2(texture, diffuse). XYZRHW without a diffuse field supplies white
alpha. The alpha test remains GREATER with reference 1; testing the converted
texture's zero alpha instead rejected every movie pixel. The DOA3 draw adapter
now selects default diffuse alpha through the presenter's existing alpha mode.

## Combat programmable draws and UI lines

The 3925 declaration builder at `0x001B3E10` writes stream/offset/type slots
at `+0x28 + 0x10*register`. CreateVertexShader `0x001B40D0` marks a program
with flag `4` at `+4`, stores its instruction count at `+0x10` and packed
word count at `+0x14`, and writes upload blocks at `+0x168`. LoadVertexShader
`0x001B42C0` copies those blocks. These differ from the 4928 offsets and flag.

The observed title-water program has 25 instructions, position/normal/UV0
in registers 0/2/9, and a 32-byte stream. The draw adapter validates this
layout, unpacks bounded program blocks through the vertex-shader model, and
uses the existing HLSL translator. Other upload command types and layouts
are rejected. Programmable output uses its own constants; the presenter
no longer requires a fixed-function transform for it.

`0x001B2BF0` computes reserved viewport constants from viewport `+0xB00`,
scale `+0x500`, depth scale `+0x4F8` and depth range `+0xB10`. Its grid bias
is 17/32 pixel, reduced by half a pixel for the back-buffer multisample case
selected by `0x001C0598` bit `0x1000` and `0x001C0590`. The adapter supplies
these constants at hardware indices 58/59. The verified water material
mirrors the scene texture and wraps its alpha mask; the host respects that
scene addressing. Stage-1 arguments are at `0x001C0200`; texture-transform
flags are at stage `+0x74`, verified by `0x001B2A70`.

Character-select UI also uses primitive 2 with FVF `0x44`. All three draw
APIs now admit even-sized line lists and the presenter submits native D3D11
line lists. Synthetic checks cover packed-block bounds, shader draws without
fixed transforms, mirrored program sampling, and line pixels/odd counts.

## DOA3 capture and remaining cage issue

`RECOMP_D3D_DRAW_CAPTURE` and `RECOMP_D3D_DRAW_CAPTURE_AT` now cover accepted
DOA3 draws; previously only the DOAXBV path emitted draw rows. The existing
frame/row bounds apply. JSON records include transforms, stream bindings,
render state and callers. Numbered `.vertices`, `.indices`, `.texture` and
`.palette` sidecars retain the inputs at submission. Use a new capture path
under `private/`. Programmable draws currently record their instruction count,
not a complete replayable program/constant snapshot.

The cage obstruction was reproduced in a capture with 1,183 accepted draws
and no declines. Pixel/triangle matching isolates a four-vertex triangle strip
using FVF `0x112`, with no vertex program or weights. It samples a light-flare
texture while blending is disabled and depth writes are enabled. The quad
crosses the near plane and covers the foreground. Its root cause remains
unresolved; neither removing the quad nor disabling wall depth/collision is
a verified correction. Later unobscured cage captures do not establish a fix.
After the shared-clock merge, an unpaced Watch Mode run reaches the cage
through Stage Select and renders a Kasumi mirror match/replay with fences
visible. It does not reproduce the earlier Bayman obstruction.

The next comparison is the offending draw's caller and guest resource/state
inputs against the 3925 library's behavior. No lifter defect has been proven.
The omitted stream byte offset is a separate mapping gap: observed offsets in
the later cage capture are zero, so that gap does not explain the obstruction.
