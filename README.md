# DOA3 Native PC Port

**A native Windows port of _Dead or Alive 3_, built by static recompilation, with the goal of rewriting it into readable source.**

## About

The original Xbox executable is lifted to C with a static recompiler, then
linked against a hand-written runtime that replaces the Xbox kernel imports
and, one entry point at a time, the Direct3D 8 and DirectSound APIs with native
Windows equivalents. The rest of the game, including its statically linked
libraries, runs as generated code. The plan is to replace game logic with
readable, hand-written source one data-structure cluster at a time once the
game runs.

The runtime comes from the sister project
[doaxbv-re](https://github.com/NoRain211/doaxbv-re), which is fully playable on
the same approach.

## Status

> [!NOTE]
> **Playable, in early testing.** Intro movie, title, menus, Story, Time
> Attack, Watch and Sparring fights with audio, stage transfers, continue and
> attract mode run on the whole-program recomp. See
> [bring-up](docs/bring-up.md) for run evidence, [history](docs/history.md)
> for how the port got here, and [runtime options](docs/runtime-options.md)
> for settings and runner flags.

| Area | State |
| --- | --- |
| Whole-program lift | Runs from boot to fights, paced to 60 Hz |
| Kernel imports | Shared with doaxbv-re |
| D3D8 3925 | Device, frame, draws, textures, vertex programs and viewport bound to DOA3 |
| DirectSound 3936 | Bound; XAudio2 output with 3D distance, Doppler and HRTF |
| CRI Sofdec movies | Play natively |
| Hand-written game logic | Stage boundary and danger-zone collision |

`recomp-runtime/` started from doaxbv-re at `f6ad13e`. Its DOAXBV address
bindings are gated off; DOA3's D3D8, DirectSound, XAPI and CRI functions are
re-bound in its adapters.

| Library | DOA3 | DOAXBV |
|---------|------|--------|
| XAPILIB, D3DX8, XGRAPHC, XBOXKRNL | 3911 | 4928 |
| D3D8 | 3925 | 4928 |
| DSOUND | 3936 | 4928 |

Both games carry CRI Sofdec (`PSGSFD*`), XPP and DOLBY sections and ship AFS
archives and SFD movies.

## Build the tests from source

The runtime tests build without any game files or submodules:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/NoRain211/doa3-re.git
cd doa3-re
cmake -S recomp-runtime -B build/recomp-runtime -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
cmake --build build/recomp-runtime --config Release --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir build/recomp-runtime -C Release --output-on-failure
```

This produces test executables, not the game runner. Passing tests does not
establish game accuracy.

## Set up a local build

```powershell
git submodule update --init
python tools/extract_iso.py <your-doa3.iso>        # -> private/imported-disc/disc
python tools/xbe_info.py private/imported-disc/disc/default.xbe
```

`extract_iso.py` needs XboxDev
[extract-xiso](https://github.com/XboxDev/extract-xiso/releases) on PATH or at
`tools/artifacts/extract-xiso.exe`. The lift and runner build are in
[docs/bring-up.md](docs/bring-up.md).

## Play

Download the ZIP from the latest
[release](https://github.com/NoRain211/doa3-re/releases/latest) and extract it
to a folder with a short path. Drag a DOA3 ISO or extracted disc folder onto
`BuildGame.cmd`, then run
`Launcher.cmd` to pick resolution, anti-aliasing, widescreen and volume and
play, or `Play.cmd` to play with the current settings; see
[docs/test-release.md](docs/test-release.md). The game keeps its cache and
saves in `private/play-disc` and each session's log in `private/play-logs`.

## Display settings

`RECOMP_D3D_SCALE` (1-8, render height multiplier; 3 renders 1920x1440
natively), `RECOMP_D3D_MSAA` (sample count, for example 4) and
`RECOMP_D3D_SMAA=1` (built from the `third_party/smaa` submodule) work as in
doaxbv-re.

Widescreen defaults off because DOA3's box lists no 16:9 support, but the
game honors the dashboard flag that `RECOMP_D3D_WIDESCREEN=1` reports: its 3D
view renders anamorphic 16:9 with a wider horizontal view. The game leaves its
2D layer alone, so the HUD and menus appear stretched.

## Contributing

Read the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) first. Translation defects are
fixed in the lifter and regenerated; generated game C is never patched by hand.

When [reporting a bug](https://github.com/NoRain211/doa3-re/issues), include
your build version, steps to reproduce, what happened, your hardware and
controller, and the stop or crash message
([how to read logs](recomp-runtime/README.md#reading-stop-and-crash-logs)).
Remove private paths from logs, and never upload game binaries, generated game
C, assets, extracted filenames, saves, BIOS data or private run evidence.

## AI assistance

This project uses large language models and AI coding agents extensively for
code, reverse-engineering analysis, debugging, tests and documentation. Their
output can contain mistakes; changes are reviewed and tested, and unverified
behavior is tracked as such.
